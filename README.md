# Note
These files contain a portion of the source code implementing the work **Hybrid Deep Network for Anomaly Detection (BMVC 2019)** ([paper](https://bmvc2019.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/0726-paper.pdf) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06347.pdf) | [demo](https://youtu.be/f5mN7tHUwHE) | [slides](https://youtu.be/NC97YvaOicU)). They support the understanding of the network architecture as well as the training and evaluation procedures. Some functions in the code were for testing some ideas during the algorithm development and were not related to the details presented in the paper.
